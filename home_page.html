			<h3>Parameterized Thread Start Delegate</h3>
			<p>Working with the <strong>ParameterizedThreadStart</strong> Delegate
				Recall that the <em>ThreadStart</em> delegate can point only to methods that return void and take no arguments. While 
				this might fit the bill in some cases, if you want to pass data to the method executing on the secondary thread, 
				you will need to use the ParameterizedThreadStart delegate type. To illustrate, let’s re-create the logic of the 
				AsyncCallbackDelegate project created earlier in this chapter, this time using the ParameterizedThreadStart 
				delegate type.
				To begin, create a new Console Application project named AddWithThreads and import the  
				System.Threading namespace. Now, given that ParameterizedThreadStart can point to any method taking 
				a <mark>System.Object parameter</mark>, you will create a custom type containing the numbers to be added, like so:</p>
