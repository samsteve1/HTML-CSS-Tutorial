	<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
	<p>This project focuses on solving the inadequate power supply from the national grid for a country with a teeming population like Nigeria. The approach uses a decentralization method through the use of a Pay As You Go Solar Energy Micro-Grid System to generate electricity to a remote/urban community.</p>

	<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
	<p>Many Rural communities are totally off the National Grid and the cost of transmitting and distributing electricity to these rural communities is relatively high. Some of the residents are left to source alternative energy from fossil fuels which are expensive to operate, even for a short period of use.</p>

	<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
	<p>Our solution is a PAYG Solar Micro-Grid which leverages on harnessing the radiations from the sun to produce electricity for use in these communities. The solar Micro-Grid consists of a battery based photovoltaic (PV) system which generates direct current (DC) electricity from the PV modules, stores excess energy in a battery bank of Deep Cycle Lead-Acid batteries and converts the DC generated to an Alternating Current (AC) to be used by various home appliances with the aid of a high wattage inverter.
	As a case study, we assume a rural community of about 50 homes. This community is not connected to the national grid; hence, this is an off Grid Solar System. From research, the basic electrical load for such remote community includes lightning, fans, and socket for charging mobile phones, television/radio and refrigerators in few homes.
	In this case, a 24KW Battery Based Solar System is required and it should be sufficient for a 24HRS or near 24HRS electricity supply for this rural community. The system consists of a PV array of 24KW, a 32KW or more pure sine wave inverter, a 120,000 WH (2500AH, 48V) battery bank and other accessories to put the system to work.
	A Pay as You Go mode of distribution shall be integrated into the system. Every home connected to our Solar Micro-Grid utilizes a Pre-paid metering system to enable payment and usage of power from the Micro-Grid. In this case, every household pays for the energy it consumes in kilowatt Hour.

<h3 id="impact">Expected Impact</h3>
<p>This solution is expected to reduce the rate of rural-urban migration and improve the socio-economic activities in rural communities by directly influencing agriculture, education, and healthcare, Micro small and medium enterprises through adequate supply of electric power. The System would also produce job opportunities in the community by employing people to run the daily activities of the system.</p>
<h3>Similar Examples</h3>
<p>Yes, a similar example is the PAYG system by ARNERGY Solar, but ours emphasizes on the importance of energy conservation. In this case, citizens only pay for the energy they use.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>The major challenge is the high upfront cost required to setup a solar system, of which is cheaper on the long run. Another is enlightening and convincing people that solar really works and it is an effective source of alternative energy.</p>
